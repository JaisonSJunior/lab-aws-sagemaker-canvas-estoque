# ðŸ“Š Intelligent Inventory Forecasting on AWS with SageMaker Canvas

As a proposed final project for the course, I tried to develop intelligent inventory forecasting model using AWS SageMaker Canvas. The dataset was provided by DIO, the course provider, through a fork in their main repository. I then edited the chosen file name in my own repository.

I couldn't achieve my goal, since I got a error regarding amazon resources and stopped in the "predict" part.
